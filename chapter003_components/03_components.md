# Components
React components are small, reusable pieces of code responsible for specific parts of the application's UI. A React app is essentially a collection of these components. Components can be created using JavaScript functions or classesâ€”functions lead to functional components, while classes create class-based components.

Traditionally, components were categorized as:

- **Functional Component / Presentational Component / Stateless Component / Dumb Component**
- **Class Component / Container Component / Stateful Component / Smart Component**

However, these distinctions are less relevant in the latest version of React, but understanding the old definitions is still valuable.

In React, components return JSX and must start with an uppercase letter. If a component's name consists of two words, it should follow CamelCase.
