## Getting Started React

This section covers prerequisites to get started with React.You should have a good understanding of the following
technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

      If you have the skills mentioned above, you will enjoy doing React. The 30 Days Of React challenge contains everything you need to know about react. In every section, it has some exercises and mini-projects, and it is recommended to work on them. This 30 Days Of React challenge will help you learn the latest version of React and the old version, step by step. The topics are broken down into 30 days, where each day contains several topics with easy-to-understand explanations, real-world examples and many hands-on exercises.
      This challenge is designed for beginners and professionals who want to build a web application using React and JavaScript.
      Once in a while you may need different dummy data to work with React. You can use the following [dummy data generator](https://www.30daysofreact.com/dummy-data) to generate different data.

### 1. What is React?

    React is a JavaScript library for building a reusable user interface(UI). It was initially released on May 29, 2013. The current version is 16.13.1 and somehow it is stable. React was created by Facebook. React makes creating UI components very easy. The official React documentation can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). When we work with React we do not interact directly with the DOM. React has its own way to handle the DOM(Document Object Model) manipulation. React uses its virtual DOM to make new changes and it updates only the element, that needs changing. Do not directly interact with DOM when you build a React Application and leave the DOM manipulation job for the React virtual DOM. In this challenge, we will develop 10-15 web applications using React. A web application, or a website, is made of buttons, links, forms with different input fields, header, footer, sections, articles, texts, images, audios, videos and boxes with different shapes. We use react to make a reusable UI components of a website.
    
    To summarize:



### 2. Why React?

    React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries. Many developers and companies have been using it for the last couple of years. Its popularity has been growing fast and it has a huge community. How do we measure popularity? One measure of popularity could be GitHub repository stars, watchers and forks. Let us compare the popularity of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue). As of today, the popularity between the two most popular JavaScript looks like as shown on the diagram. From the diagram, you can speculate the most popular JavaScript library. You may look at the number of watchers, stars and forks for both React and Vue. These alone will not be a very good measure of popularity, but still it tells a little bit about the popularity of the two technologies. If I have to recommend another JavaScript library next to React, it would be Vue.js.



Why we choose to use React ? We use it because of the following reasons:

- fast
- modular
- scalable
- flexible
- big community and popular
- open source
- High job opportunity

### 3. JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML elements with JavaScript code. An HTML element has an opening and closing tags, content, and attribute in the opening tag. However, some HTML elements may not have content and a closing tag - they are self closing elements. To create HTML elements in React we do not use the _createElement()_ instead we just use JSX elements. Therefore, JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML elements in React. JSX will be converted to JavaScript on browser using a transpiler - [babel.js](https://babeljs.io/). Babel is a library which transpiles JSX to pure JavaScript and latest JavaScript to older version. See the JSX code below.

```js
// JSX syntax
// we don't need to use quotes with JSX

const jsxElement = <h1>I am a JSX element</h1>
const welcome = <h1>Welcome to React Challenge</h1>
const data = <small>Oct 2, 2020</small>
```

The above strange looking code seems like JavaScript and it seems like , but it is not JavaScript and it seems like HTML but not completely an HTML element. It is a mix of JavaScript and an HTML elements. JSX can allow us to use HTML in JavaScript. The HTML element in the JSX above is _h1_ and _small_.

#### JSX Element

As you have seen in the example above, JSX has a JavaScript and HTML like syntax. JSX element could be a single HTML element or many HTML elements wrapped in a parent HTML element.

This JSX element has only one HTML element which is _h1_.

```js
const jsxElement = <h1>I am a JSX element</h1> // JS with HTML
```

Let's make more JSX elements by declaring a new variable named title and content inside _h2_.

```js
const title = <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
```

Let us add a subtitles and other contents to this JSX element by adding additional HTML elements. Every HTML element should be wrapped by an outer HTML element to create a valid JSX element. The name title variable also should be changed to header because our JSX element is containing almost all of the header of the application.

```js
const header = (
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to 30 Days Of React</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
    <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
  </header>
)
```

Let us keep adding more elements. Additional HTML elements to display the author name and year.

```js
const header = (
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to 30 Days Of React</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
    <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
    <p>Asabeneh Yetayeh</p>
    <small>Oct 2, 2020</small>
  </header>
)
```

As you can see the _header_ element is a parent element for all the inner HTML elements and JSX must be wrapped by an outer parent element. Without the _header_ HTML element or other parent HTML element the above JSX is invalid.

#### Commenting a JSX element

We comment codes for different reasons and it is also good to know how to comment out JSX elements in React.

```js
{
  /*
 <header>
    <h1>Welcome to 30 Days Of React</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started React</h2>
    <h3>JavaScript Library</h3>
    <p>Asabeneh Yetayeh</p>
    <small>Oct 2, 2020</small>
  </header>

*/
}
```
